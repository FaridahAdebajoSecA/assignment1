## Reflection

During the development of this project, I learned how to effectively use HTML5 and CSS3 to create a structured and visually appealing website. The use of semantic elements improved the accessibility of the website. Implementing a responsive design using flexbox was particularly challenging but rewarding, as it enhanced the user experience across different devices.
